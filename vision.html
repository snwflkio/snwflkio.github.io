						<p style="font-size: 2vh;">
							Having been interested in computer science since before college, we find that it's taught us valuable skills and a valuable mindset. Encouraging a growth mindset in students still in primary school we believe will help drive an interest in STEM fields. Letting kids practice their creativity is important in STEM education, although it's also important to destigmatize STEM. Our core belief is to encourage students to consider STEM classes in school as well as a potential career.

						<p class="display-4">What We've <span style="color: #3090C7">Noticed</span></p>
						<p style="font-size: 2vh;">
							Through numerous empathy interviews with STEM teachers and in particular computer science teachers, we've noticed three main issues. The first being a lack of the growth mindset in being taught in schools. Students are taught early on that the solution of a probblem is the most important part. While this is true, understanding the process of how to reach the solution can be more valuable. We've found that teachers notice students can be easily discouraged when focusing solely on the answer. Discouragement is the second issue we've noticed. A Stigma is placed around STEM and related fields as being successful for only a certain demographic. The third issue is focusing on parents, and helping them encourage their students in STEM subjects. Anti-tech or tech-neutral parents may not expose their children to STEM because of a similar mindset. Although not every student may want to pursue a career in STEM, those who are interested should be encouraged.

						<p style="font-size: 2vh;">
							By effectively engaging students with their smartphones, we will allow them to practice their creativity while still teaching them valuable programming skills. Unlike systems like Scratch, Tynker and MIT App Inventor we will allow students to make their own mobile applications without the need of third party software. Using the latest in web technology, we can enable students to design, create, and download their own unique mobile applications directly onto their phone, avoiding the intense vetting process of an app store.
